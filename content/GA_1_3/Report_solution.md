# Report for Group Assignment 1.3

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.3, Friday, Sep 20, 2024.*

_This assignment is to be turned in by uploading files to GitHub (as done with PA 1.3, but for the GA 1.3 repository)._

_Most of the questions require you to finish `Analysis.ipynb` first, but depending on how you allocate tasks between group members, it is possible to work on this in parallel. Make sure you save time for peer reviewing each others work before completing the assignment!_

_We don't expect long answers; be as concise as possible (just a few sentences max, usually); however, it is critical to support your arguments with qualitative observations (e.g., describe specific figures) and quantitative evidence (report results of calculations, values, etc) from `Analysis.ipynb` whenever possible._
