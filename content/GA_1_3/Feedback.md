# README for Group Assignment 1.3

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.3, Friday, Sep 20, 2024.*

_See the README for more information about this assignment._

1. When reporting a value, it is important to report the unit together with the value.
2. When answering a question with multiple sub-questions, it will be helpful to answer different sub-questions in different paragraphs, instead of using one paragraph for all the answers.
3. When checking the discrepancy of the model and data, not only the histogram but also the plot of residuals should be checked.

Q2: this was the most tricky question for most groups. The solution has been updated with an additional paragraph to explain. If you are not sure how to interpret that, refer to the book and study the equations that indicate quantitatively which values (matrices) are included in the calculation for each confidence interval.
