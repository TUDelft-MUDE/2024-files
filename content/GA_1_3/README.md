# README for Group Assignment 1.3

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.3, Friday, Sep 20, 2024.*

_This assignment is to be turned in by uploading files to GitHub (as done with PA 1.3, but for the GA 1.3 repository)._





The files in this Group Assignment (GA) are set up to prepare you for a "real" project next week, which you will have to submit for feedback and part of your Assignment Portfolio grade. There are three critical files to be aware of:

1. `README.md`: this file, which contains and introduction and instructions.
2. `Analysis.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook which contains the primary analysis to complete during the in-class session.
3. `Report.md`: a Markdown file containing questions about the findings of Analysis, as well additional questions to check your understanding of the topic for this week.

You are expected to read and _work through each of the above files sequentially._ complete all tasks in the Analysis notebook and answer all questions in the Report by 12:30. You should leave the cell outputs in the notebook.

_Note that this week the GA does not need to be turned in. However, we still recommend you edit the files and save your work._

We recommend you keep the Workshop assignment from this week (WS 1.2) handy to complete this assignment!

### Working Method

We recommend that you select the computers of two group members to record your work: one computer for the `Analysis.ipynb`, the other for the `Report.md`. To collaborate we recommend an app like WhatsApp to send text and code (_this week only!_); it is not ideal, but next week we will learn a _much_ better way to collaborate!


**Once you have read everything above, continue with the `Analysis.ipynb`**

**End of file.**
