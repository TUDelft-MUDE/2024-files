*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.3, Friday, Sep 20, 2024.*

_Remember to read the grading and submission instructions in the `README.md` file thoroughly before finalizing your answers in this document!_

## Questions

**Question 1**

Give a short explanation about the data and the models we created. Include brief statements about the data, including an explanation of the groundwater interpolation step and why it was necessary.

_Your answer should only be a few sentences long, and be sure to use quantitative information! You do not need to reproduce the model, but it would be useful to do things like confirm the number of models, model parameters, observations, etc. You can use bullet lists to summarize and state interesting information._

_Write your answer here._

**Question 2**

Describe what the confidence intervals are and mention specifically the type of information that is included in the algorithm to calculate. Make observations about the CI's for each model, and explain why all of the data points are not contained within the interval, even though the value is close to 100%.

_Hint: which uncertainties are propagated into the CI? Are the intervals uniform for the entire time series?_

_Write your answer here._

**Question 3**

Do you see any systematic effects in the residuals for each model? Make a few relevant observations about the residuals and the , do you see any systematic effect? Give your interpretation for any discrepancy between observations and the model.

_It may be useful to include qualitative and quantitative observations about the residuals, for example, the histogram/PDF comparison and the moments of the residuals._

_Write your answer here._

**Question 4**

Compare the results you found for the InSAR observations and the GNSS observations. Discuss the differences between the results. Be quantitative!

_Write your answer here._

**Last Question: How did things go? (Optional)**

_Use this space to let us know if you ran into any challenges while working on this GA, and if you have any feedback to report._
