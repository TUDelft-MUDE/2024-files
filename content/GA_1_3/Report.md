# Report for Group Assignment 1.3

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.3, Friday, Sep 20, 2024.*

_This assignment is to be turned in by uploading files to GitHub (as done with PA 1.3, but for the GA 1.3 repository)._

_Most of the questions require you to finish `Analysis.ipynb` first, but depending on how you allocate tasks between group members, it is possible to work on this in parallel. Make sure you save time for peer reviewing each others work before completing the assignment!_

_We don't expect long answers; be as concise as possible (just a few sentences max, usually); however, it is critical to support your arguments with qualitative observations (e.g., describe specific figures) and quantitative evidence (report results of calculations, values, etc) from `Analysis.ipynb` whenever possible._

## Questions

**Question 1**

Explain what the groundwater interpolation accomplished and why we had to do it.

_Your answer here._

**Question**

Interpretation questions:

- When you plot the residuals vs time, do you see any systematic effect? Give your interpretation for any discrepancy between observations and the model.
- What is the mean value of the residuals?
- What is the standard deviation of the residuals?
- What can you conclude when you compare the histogram of the data with the computed normal distribution? 
- Did you use quantitative results in your answers?

_Your answer here._

**Question**

Compare the results you found for the InSAR observations and the GNSS observations in the questions above. Discuss the differences between the results. Be quantitative!
