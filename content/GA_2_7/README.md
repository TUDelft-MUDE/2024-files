# README for Group Assignment 2.7

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/).: Week 2.7, Friday, Jan 10, 2025.*

The focus of this assignment is to use extreme value analysis to analyze the flooding last October in Tur√≠s (close to Valencia, Spain), where 771 mm of rain fell in a single day!

## Overview of material

- `README.md` (this file)
- `Report.md`, primary file in which you write your answers to questions.
- `Analysis.ipynb`, the notebook in which you will perform the EVA.
- a file `turis.csv` containing the data for this assignment.

## The Boring Stuff

We will only be grading responses in the Markdown file, not the notebook. Otherwise, you know the GA drill by now, so let's get started with the notebook!

**End of file.**
