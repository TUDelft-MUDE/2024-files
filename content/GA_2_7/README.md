# README for Group Assignment 2.7

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 2.7, Friday, Jan 10, 2025.*

_You can access this assignment with the following link: [classroom.github.com/a/XnhN63_7](https://classroom.github.com/a/XnhN63_7)._

The focus of this assignment is to use extreme value analysis to analyze the flooding last October in Tur√≠s (close to Valencia, Spain), where 771 mm of rain fell in a single day!

## Overview of material

- `README.md` (this file)
- `Analysis.ipynb`, the notebook in which you will perform the EVA.
- `Report.md`, primary file in which you write your answers to questions.
- a file `turis.csv` containing the data for this assignment.

## Details

For this assignment, consider the following:
- everyone should view and discuss the data together to underestand it's characteristics
- you could split up the programming tasks for BM, POT and return levels, but make sure everyone knows how both approaches work, as both are part of the exam material
- POT requires a threshold, which makes it different than BM in a key way, so don't forget to check that in particular if you work on BM

For the report:
- You should include figures to support your answers.
- Question 5 will have the heaviest weight in the grading (~2-3x that of the other questions).
- Question 1 has the least weight and is mostly used to highlight the nuances discussed in other questions.

We will only be grading responses in the Markdown Report file, not the notebook.

You know the GA drill by now, so let's get started with the notebook!
