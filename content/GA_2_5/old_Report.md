## Questions

### Solving NDP problem with MILP

1. Has the optimal solution been found? (yes/no)

2. If there is a gap, what can you tell about the value of the best solution you are still theoretically able to obtain?

3. Consider now that the network operator does not want to surpass the capacity in every link. How do you write that constraint? Reminding you that in the current model it is possible to go beyond the capacity which makes traffic even slower (even higher travel time)

4. What do you observe in the solution when you run this new model for 20 links and expanded capacity of 1.5 (default increase)?

5. What can you do to fix that?

### Solving NDP problem with GA

1. What very important solution performance indicator did you lose by using the GA metaheuristic in comparison with MILP?

2. Try to obtain a better solution in the same computation time. What parameter is best to change to get that improvement? write your results in the box.

3. Run the model with a small number of links (=1) and a big number of links (max=76), what differences do you see in the solutions and computation time compared with the previous model? and why?

### Comparison

1. Compare the GA approach with MILP approach. For the same computation time which one is faster?
