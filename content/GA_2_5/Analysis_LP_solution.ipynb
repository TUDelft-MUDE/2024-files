    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The road network design problem (NDP) is the problem of determining which links to build/refurbish/upgrade in order to improve the performance of a road network. One of the variations of the road NDP is the road NDP with capacity expansions, which involves deciding which links should have their capacity increased. This is a complex problem that must take into account a variety of factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The current state of the road network\n",
    "* The projected future traffic demand\n",
    "* The budget available for improvements\n",
    "* The impacts of the adjustments (could be environmental, social, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of approaches to dealing with the road network design problem with capacity expansion. One common approach is to use mathematical optimization models. In this assignment we use a simplified example to show how optimization can be used to tackle road NDPs. Note that the classical approaches to dealing with road NDPs can be more complicated and will be covered in other courses in the TTE track of the civil engineering master program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the goal is to minimize the total travel time on the network by selecting a predefined number of links for capacity expansion (subject to the available budget). The following (main) assumptions and simplifications are made to make the problem solvable using methods and algorithms that you have learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Link travel time function\n",
    "Travel time on a stretch of road (i.e., a link) depends on the flow (vehicles/hour) on that link and the capacity of the link (maximum of vehicles/hour). The most common function to calculate travel time on a link is the so-called Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function, which is a polynomial (degree 4) function. That function, if used in the assignment, would make the problem non-linear and therefore very hard to solve. So we use a simplified linear function where travel time grows linearly with the flow of vehicles on a road link. More details are provided within the formulation section.\n",
    "\n",
    "![link_travel_time_function.png](./figs/link_travel_time_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "${t_{ij}} = t_{ij}^0\\left( {1 + \\alpha {{\\left( {\\cfrac{x_{ij}}{c_{ij}}} \\right)}^\\beta }} \\right) \\quad \\left( {i,j} \\right) \\in A$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $t_{ij}$ is the current travel time on the link, $t_{ij}^0$ is the travel time without congestion (free flow), $x_{ij}$ is the flow of cars, and $_c{ij}$ the capacity in maximum flow of cars. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are calibration parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Route choice behavior\n",
    "In order to assess the quality of the road capacity expansion problem, one must know what the effect of the added capacity is on travel time. For that, it is not sufficient to model the travel time-flow function, you must know where the vehicles are going to drive on the road. The route choice behavior of drivers within congested networks often follows the so-called User Equilibrium (UE) principle where each traveller tries to minimize their own individual generalized travel time.The UE states that for each origin and destination pair, all used routes between those nodes have equal and minimal travel time. That is, no driver can improve his/her travel time by choosing another path, therefore an equilibrium is reached.\n",
    "However, calculating the UE requires advanced methods which are not covered in the MUDE. Therefore, here we assume the route choice behaviour follows the so-called System Optimal (SO) principle, which implies that route choices are made in such a way that the total travel time is minimized (summed over all the drivers). That means that some cars will drive longer routes so that other cars can save time. This is also called social equilibrium. This type of equilibrium is easier to compute. But just have in mind that in our road networks you can hardly obtain a system optimal traffic distribution. You can't tell where drivers have to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./figs/sketchoptimization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Quadratic terms\n",
    "As you will see in the formulation below, even after making the above-mentioned assumptions, our formulation of the Road NDP will include a quadratic term, you must multiply the flow (which is a variable) by the tavel time (which is also a variable). This is therefore not linear. \n",
    "Fortunately there are different methods to transform quadratic terms to linear variables and constraints with mathematical programming. You do not need to learn these techniques. Most solvers (including Gurobi) can handle this well given some adjustments to the formulation. Gurobi uses the [McCormick Envelops (MCE)](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=McCormick_envelopes) to transform each quadratic term into one new variable and four constraints. For more information on MCE and how Gurobi implements them, check these links (this is in case you are interested, you don't need to check them during the Friday session):\n",
    "* [The theory behind MCE](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=McCormick_envelopes)\n",
    "* [Gurobi webinar presentation on quadratic optimization](https://cdn.gurobi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-01-14_Non-Convex-Quadratic-Optimization-in-Gurobi-9.0-Webinar.pdf?x93374)\n",
    "* [Full video of the webinar](https://www.gurobi.com/events/non-convex-quadratic-optimization/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will move forward with a quadratic term in the objective function then because with the simplifcations and assumptions referred to above we can formulate an NDP and solve it using the branch and bound method that you have studied before.\n"
