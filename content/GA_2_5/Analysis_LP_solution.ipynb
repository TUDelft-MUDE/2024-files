    "# Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: part of the background material for this project was already available in the textbook._\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the goal is to minimize the total travel time on the network by selecting a predefined number of links for capacity expansion (subject to the available budget).\n",
    "\n",
    "The road network design problem (NDP) is the problem of determining which links to build/refurbish/upgrade in order to improve the performance of a road network. One of the variations of the road NDP is the road NDP with capacity expansions, which involves deciding which links should have their capacity increased. This is a complex problem that must take into account a variety of factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The current state of the road network\n",
    "* The projected future traffic demand\n",
    "* The budget available for improvements\n",
    "* The impacts of the adjustments (could be environmental, social, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of approaches to dealing with the road network design problem with capacity expansion. One common approach is to use mathematical optimization models. In this assignment we use a simplified example to show how optimization can be used to tackle road NDPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following (main) assumptions and simplifications are made to make the problem solvable using methods and algorithms that you have learned so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Link travel time function\n",
    "Travel time on a stretch of road (i.e., a link) depends on the flow (vehicles/hour) on that link and the capacity of the link (maximum of vehicles/hour). The most common function to calculate travel time on a link is the so-called Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function, which is a polynomial (degree 4) function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use a simplified linear function where travel time grows linearly with the flow of vehicles on a road link: \n",
    "\n",
    "$${t_{ij}} = t_{ij}^0\\left( {1 + \\alpha {{\\left( {\\cfrac{x_{ij}}{c_{ij}}} \\right)}^\\beta }} \\right) \\quad \\left( {i,j} \\right) \\in A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $t_{ij}$ is the current travel time on the link, $t_{ij}^0$ is the travel time without congestion (free flow), $x_{ij}$ is the flow of cars, and $_c{ij}$ the capacity in maximum flow of cars. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are calibration parameters. More details are provided within the formulation section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Route choice behavior\n",
    "In order to assess the quality of the road capacity expansion problem, one must know what the effect of the added capacity is on travel time. The route choice behavior of drivers within congested networks often follows the so-called User Equilibrium (UE) principle where each traveller tries to minimize their own individual generalized travel time. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, calculating the UE requires advanced methods which are not covered in the MUDE. Therefore, here we assume the route choice behaviour follows the so-called System Optimal (SO) principle, which implies that route choices are made in such a way that the total travel time is minimized (summed over all the drivers). That means that some cars will drive longer routes so that other cars can save time. But have in mind that in our road networks you can hardly obtain a system optimal traffic distribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the simplifcations and assumptions referred to above we can formulate an NDP and solve it using the branch and bound method (that you have studied before).\n"

    "The demand of the network is given by an **OD matrix**, which will be constructed below. The OD matrix is as table that tells you how many cars go from node i to node j in an a given timeframe. The paths between the nodes are chosen by solving the optimization model."
