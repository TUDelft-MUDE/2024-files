hind1,Month: 05,Day: 16,Hour: 14,Minute: 10,""The first thought was to maximize the chance of winning, which is achieved by buying tickets for the most probable dates and times of breaking. The CDF of the winnings showed that the selected tickets had relatively low winnings. The prize is split by all ticket holders of the correct time and date, so this is an indication that these tickets were already bought by a lot of people. The next thought was shifting the ticket selection of the center of probability-density function, so that the tickets will be shared with less people. We found that shifting to dates later than the expected breaking day (May 12) had the most positive effect on the expected profit. However, the selected ticket range was still very large and thus the risk too high. To see what the most profitable hour and day in our range were, we iteratively ran every option. The most optimal profit to cost ratio was found for the tickets between 2PM and 3PM on May 16.We picked minute 10 because between 13 and 15 hours it was closer to 13 where we observed the higher profit margin.""
hind2,Month: 04,Day: 30,Hour: 13,Minute: 47,""2024 was a very warm year and we think because of that the day will be earlier than the mean. For the time we just took a guess close to the mean.""

hind4,Month: 04,Day: 25,Hour: 14,Minute: 43,""For this question we keep the original distribution, but also keep in mind the previously mentioned aspect that the historical data does not differentiate between old and recent data. The majority of the people that buy their tickets will probably look at the same distribution and buy a guess in a very average date, close to the mode on day 33 (May 4).Our final guess is a combination of observing a slight trend in the breakage date of the recent (20 years) that is declining, along with the knowledge that fewer guesses are made at lower than average dates. This would increase our winnings in case of a correct guess and also take the trend into account.""

At 14:00 the Kiev electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of Chernobyl's output be postponed, as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster). We think it had a big impact on people's lives and that's why we wanted to represent these important numbers in our guess.""
hind7,Month: 05,Day: 14,Hour: 14,Minute: 23,""The distribution of 2025 resembles the distribution of 2013. The breaking day in 2013 was 12th of May. We then put values around May 12 (whole day) into our model and checked the profits. It showcased that May 14 maximized the profits. For May 14, gives a better probability of winning with higher profit. Although we did not directly incorporate full ice thickness and discharge analyses into the ticket selection, these variables remain critical for refining the prediction.""

ming6,Month: 04,Day: 14,Hour: 13,Minute: 34,""We asked ChatGPT to run an extensive recursion analysis on the data of the last couple of years and take into account the trend of the climate change, together with an input of all current events like the civil war in Ethiopia. Then, after carefully reviewing all our options we decided to pay a visit to the site of the Nenana River in Alaska. We spent three weeks there measuring the thickness of the ice in the surrounding area and precipitation in the air. We also immersed ourselves in local tradition and cuisine to get into the correct headspace to be able to make a final guess. As a final measure we flew to Los Angeles and talked to the Berkeley University of California's lead investigator/professor in the field of ice studies at the faculty of natural sciences, Cornelius Smokesbeard. He was able to provide significant information on the subject and a plethora of reading materials to make our guess more informed, as well as being a wonderful host who makes a mean iced tea. We are confindent that our guess is the best one that can possibly be made, but are also aware of the limitations of guessing on such a complex process. For that reason we will also be praying to various spirits to help us win.""

ming15,Month: 04,Day: 15,Hour: 16,Minute: 23,""To maximize our chances of winning and increase our potential payout in the Ice Classic, we can take a strategic two-fold approach.First, we should refine our prediction by targeting the specific day and minute when the ice is most likely to break. Given the ongoing effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures and earlier thawing seasons, it is logical to focus on an earlier date than the historical averages. Warmer winters and earlier spring melts are trends that can guide our predictions and improve accuracy.Second, we can strategically increase our potential winnings by avoiding heavily favored dates. If most participants bet on historically popular dates, the prize will be split among more winners if those dates are correct. By selecting a less popular date ideally one slightly earlier due to climate trends we reduce the chance of splitting the prize, thereby maximizing our individual payout if our prediction is correct.This approach combines accurate climate-informed predictions with strategic betting to improve both the likelihood of success and the potential reward.""
