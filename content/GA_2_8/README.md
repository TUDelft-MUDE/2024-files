# README for GA 2.8: [Ice Ice Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE)

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 2.8, Friday, Jan 16th, 2025.*

The focus of this assignment is having fun! Oh yeah...and also learning about risk analysis.

You will evaluate the distribution of profit for the Ice Classic, generate a risk curve, then determine what an appropriate bet could be.

Remember that the Ice Classic is betting game where you buy a ticket and guess the **minute** at which the ice in the Nenana River in Alaska breaks. Everyone with the winning ticket splits the prize money, which is typically around $300,000! Remember that each ticket costs $3.

## Overview of material

- stuff
- `tickets_per_minute.pkl` (in subdirectory `pickles/`)
- The [Solution from GA 1.1](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/files/Week_1_1/), which is a PDF that contains a **lot** of good summary information about the Ice Classic that will be useful for the end of the GA, especially where you need to consider a "future" bet.

Note in particular that the file `tools.py` contains a _lot_ of poorly documented code. It can do a lot, but only Robert and Gabriel have any idea how to use it, so find them if you want to do something special. Otherwise, everything you need for the GA is illustrated somewhere in the notebooks. 

## Python Environments

There is a good chance that you will get a "package not installed" error. Don't worry, you are more than capable of fixing this by running a notebook cell with `!pip install <package-name>`. Or by opening up a CLI and running `pip install...`, or `conda install...` ... you get the idea.

## Task Overview

It's probably best if you work with each other to recap what the key details of the Ice Classic are about, and study the PDF of the solution from Week 1.1 together to remember some key points. Otherwise, you can subdivide these things:
- distributions of minute/day and tickets purchased per minute
- choosing a few "betting strategies"
- identifying the risk limit line for your group
- report writing

And don't forget to submit a bet for your ticket!
