# Project 12: Break-Up

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/).*

Our primary task this week is to work through the exercises in the book chapter.

That said, we have also provided a few extra activities to keep things fun (and earn your final 10 points for the Project Portfolio), but also reflect a bit on MUDE and prepare for the exam. As you may recall from [lecture](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/course-files/Week_2_8/), we also need to make a prediction for when the ice at Nenana will break apart this spring! Remember, however, we aren't trying to make you into [gamblers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hx4gdlfamo), but rather, evidence-focused scientists and engineers! To do so we will complete a simple analysis to support your break-up prediction.

There are three primary Parts for this project:

1. Make a prediction for break-up date and time (this can be iterative, based on results from 2 and 3)
2. Use break-up data to evaluate the chance your prediction may be correct
3. Make a pitch! Revisit the "ultimate model" from Q1, Week 1 and descrive how we can use MUDE methods to improve our predictions of break-up

_Code to make calculations for Part 2 is in the notebook `data_analysis.ipynb`, and your answers will be added to `Report.md`. Instructions for Parts 1 and 3 are in `Report.md`. Part 3 requires no coding, and every group member should contribute._

_Note that by including the csv file in your repo we intentionally violated our "good data practices" policy to avoid the extra step of having to download and copy data. You're welcome ;)_

In addition, there is a bonus task worth up to **3 bonus points**, but not all group members need to participate. It involves doing additional MUDE analysis with the data provided; see the instructions in file `Bonus.md`. _Unless all group members are participating in the bonus, please do not start the bonus until you are done with Parts 1-3._

## Overview of material

- `README.md` (this file)
- `Report.md`, primary file in which you write your answers to Parts 1, 2 and 3.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`, the notebook in which you will perform calculations for Part 2
- `data.csv`, the data: a record of year, month, day, hour and minute for _all_ historic break-up events in the Nenana Ice Classic
- `Bonus.md`, the file where you can describe your bonus analysis (see instructions there)
- `QR_ice_interest.png`, a QR code for the survey (see below)

## More of the usual stuff that you don't read anyway

You can use your usual `mude` environment, the deadline is still 12:30 and we won't be running a static check. Remember the deadline for all PA's is the next Monday at 8:45!

## More Ice!

If you are interested in continuing your MUDE journey after Q2, Robert is planning to set up an informal group that meets every couple weeks to explore the ice data further. Note: depending on interest, there is a medium to high probability of there being **free food.** If you are interested, please fill out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/e/MmLJMZYwy5) and he will get in touch by the end of January with further details. You can also use this QR code:
