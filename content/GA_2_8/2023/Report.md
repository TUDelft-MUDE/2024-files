# Project 12 Report: the ice is back!

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/).*

**YOUR GROUP NAME HERE**

Fill in the answers to the questions below. Parts 1 and 2 are based on the notebook `cost_benefit.ipynb` whereas instructions for Part 3 are included in this document.

_Continue applying the same general formatting requirements that we have been using for previous projects in Q2._

## Questions

### Part 1: Prediction

**Enter your final prediction in the Markdown table below. Include 1 or 2 sentences that explain your justification for the predition.**

_While you are encouraged to try and utilize the information provided as part of Part 2 (`data_analysis.ipynb`), you are not required to do so, as long as you justify your reasoning. For example, it is perfectly fine to say something like this: "we ran the numbers for a few guesses and determined that the probability was small, so we just went with the birthday of Max's grandmother", which happens to land on a Thursday this year, so we also picked 17:00._

_Note: we will be automatically parsing this file, so please make sure you don't alter the text in these lines, except to add your prediction (use integers for the month, day and time, and AM or PM in the last column)!_

| Group Name | Month |  Day  |  Hour  | Minute | AM or PM? |
| :--------: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: | :-------: |
|            |       |       |        |        |           |

### Part 2: Probability of Your Prediction Being Correct

**Assuming a normal distribution for days and minutes in the day, state the probability of your final prediction being correct. Describe how you made the computation with one or two sentences (you are also encouraged to use an equation), as well as any assumptions that were made.**

_Use `data_analysis.ipynb` to perform your analyses._

### Part 3: Constructing the Ultimate Model, Revisited

Your MUDE teachers have identified a group of investors who want to buy Nenana Ice Classic tickets, and you need to give them a preliminary design of a prediction model to convince them to invest in your idea to win the bet! Write a pitch that includes _at least_ 5 different topics from the list here:

| ID |  Quarter/Week  | Topic      |
| :----: | :----: | :--------- |
| A | 1.2 | Uncertainty propagation |
| B | 1.3-1.4 | Observation Theory |
| C | 1.5-1.6, 2.1, 2.2 | Finite ________ Methods |
| D | 1.7-1.8, 2.7 | Continuous Distributions, EVA |
| E | 2.3 | Signal Processing |
| F | 2.4 | Time Series Analysis |
| G | 2.5 | Optimization |
| H | 2.6 | Machine Learning |
| I | 2.7-2.8 | Risk, Reliability, EVA

Assume that the people evaluating your pitch have a level of knowledge that is somewhere between a business manager at an engineering firm and that of a teacher or researcher in the CEG faculty (but are not necessarily your MUDE teachers). In other words, you should show the ability to explain the basic idea behind MUDE subjects simply and _concisely._

**For this Part it will be useful to refer back to the handout from our very first Project in Week 1, which can be found [here](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/course-files/Project_1/).**

Your pitch will be evaluated on the following:
- Includes the following elements: outline of the predictive model, methods, assumptions, strengths, weaknesses (but no calculations).
- Includes visual representations as needed to illustrate the method; specifically, an equation, diagram or sketch
- Is formatted in an easy-to-read manner
- Length: your pitch must be short and to the point!

## General Comments on the Assignment [optional]

_Use this space to let us know if you encountered any issues completing this assignment (but please keep it short!). For example, if you encountered an error that could not be fixed in your Python code, or perhaps there was a problem submitting something via GitLab. You can also let us know if the instructions were unclear. You can delete this section if you don't use it._
