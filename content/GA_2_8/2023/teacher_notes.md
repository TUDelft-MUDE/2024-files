# Project 12 Notes

For teachers.

if students ask about exam questions today, tell them our general policy is NO FORMULA SHEET. it's posted all over our platforms, and it really just comes down to individual students asking separately and not reading. if we get a lot of pressure, try to collect info about what they need (e.g., which topics) and if needed we will get an update via BS end of today.


Encourage group participation for Part 3. There may be a tendency to split tasks. Some students may also start on the bonus quickly, but Tasks 1-3 should be finished first.


The 3 types of time variables may be confusing. Encourage students to explore and think about the data. One way would be to plot the data by year. Or visit a site like [this one](https://akclimate.org/nenana-ice-classic/).
