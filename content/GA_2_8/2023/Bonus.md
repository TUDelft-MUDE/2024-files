# Project 12: Break-Up Bonus

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/).*

Completing the bonus part of the assignment can earn up to 3 extra credit points. Complete the analysis in a notebook `Bonus.ipynb`, which you create by making a copy of `data_analysis.ipynb` and committing it to your repo.

This file is to report any bonus analysis you attempt. You are free to do whatever you like as long as:
- it is in addition to the non-bonus part of P12
- it uses real data (e.g., `data.csv`, but feel free to include other relevant data)
- you document it in this file, or in `Bonus.ipynb`

Some suggestions for what you can try are:
- fit non-Normal distributions to the data
- plot the CDF of the hours and days
- run goodness of fit tests to validate the probability models
- evaluate dependence between break-up day and time of day (minutes)
- be creative!

Your results will be evaluated on creativity and insight, not amount of analysis performed or level of detail (in other words, you don't have to do a lot of coding to get all 3 bonus points!).

### Participation

List the group members who participated in the bonus part of the assignment by filling in your names and student numbers. If all group members participated equally in the bonus, leave the table empty.

_Note: we will be automatically parsing this file, so please make sure you don't alter the text in these lines except as described above! You can make the columns wider/narrower, but don't change the pipe symbols._

|  Name               | Student Number |
| :------------------ | :------------: |
|                     |                |
|                     |                |
|                     |                |
|                     |                |
|                     |                |


### Prediction (optional)

If you are able to make an improved prediction due to your bonus analysis, enter this in the table below, along with a justification for why your prediction is different than that in `Report.md`. If you do not make an improved prediction, leave the table blank.

_Note: we will be automatically parsing this file, so please make sure you don't alter the text in these lines, except to add your prediction (use integers for the month, day and time, and AM or PM in the last column)!_

| Group Name | Month |  Day  |  Hour  | Minute | AM or PM? |
| :--------: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----: | :-------: |
|            |       |       |        |        |           |

_If you made an additional prediction, add the justification here in one or two sentences._

### Method and Results

_Include a summary of the additional results you performed here. You are free to refer to the notebook `Bonus.ipynb` as much as you like, but in order to help us understand the analysis, please provide at least a brief description here._
