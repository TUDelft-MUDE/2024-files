# Report for Group Assignment 1.5

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.5, Friday, Oct 4, 2024.*

Remember there are "Tips for Writing the Report" in the [GA 1.3 README](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/files/GA_1_3/README.html).

## Questions

## Numerical Derivatives

**Question 1**

Explain what the time derivative of the ice thickness represents and why it would be incorrect to compute it at once for the entire data set. 

_Write your answer here._

**Question 2**

Summarize the number of ice thickness measurements, number of intervals and number of values calculated for each numerical derivative. Note any differences about the time value at which each derivative is computed. Then, explain why there are differences between each method. For each method, at which points are the time derivative missing? Why can't Central Differences be evaluated at the same time/location as the data points?

_Write your answer here._

**Question 3**

Insert the image of your results showing the measurements and the three numerical derivatives. What can you conclude of the accuracy of the growth rate estimation? In this case, what are the two reasons that make CD more (much more) accurate than FE/BE?

## Taylor Series Expansion

**Question 4**

Insert an image of your derivation of the first four derivatives of Task 2.1.

_Insert image here_

**Question 5**

Insert an image of your results corresponding to Task 2.5.

**Question 6**

How do the errors behave for the four TSE? Which one is more accurate near $x_0$? Farther away $x_0+5$? What is your opinion about using TSE for approximating harmonic functions (as the one in this exercise)?

_Write your answer here_

**Question 7**
