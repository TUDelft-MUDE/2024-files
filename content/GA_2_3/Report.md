# Project 7 Report: Signal Processing

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/).*

**YOUR GROUP NAME HERE**


## Primary Task

**Complete the notebook `P7.ipynb`, copy the plots and write your answers to the questions below.** Typically a short, one-line answer is sufficient; though a simple 'yes' or 'no' is _not_ sufficient, please include a short reasoning, justification or argumentation.

_You will be graded on the plots and answers provided in this file. You can delete the instructions and any other unnecessary text prior to submission._

## Report Instructions

Remember to use Markdown features to clearly indicate your answers for each question below. 

**Importing figures into a Markdown file:** in Project 5 and 6 we noticed a lot of figures not rendering properly in the Markdown file (i.e., broken image links); this was typically due to spaces in the file name. To avoid rendering issues in your Markdown reports, we recommend *not* including spaces in the filename as a general rule (e.g., `my_image.png` instead of `my image.png`). If you need to include an image in Markdown with a space in it, replace the space with `%20`. For example, to show file `my image.png` you should use: `![My image](my%20image.png)`
