# Offline Book

If you expect that you will have limited access to internet and would like to read to the MUDE book offline, click the link below to download the book in a zip file. Note the following:
- the files are intended only for MUDE students; do not share them with others
- some interactive features will not work (for example, the Python code)

[Click here to download the book, but note --> it is over 200MB!](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/fileshare/public/public/241218_offline_book.zip)

If you really want to use the code you can download the page as a notebook and use it in VS Code (this "download" should still work when offline).
