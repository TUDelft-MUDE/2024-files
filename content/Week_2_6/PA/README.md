# PA 2.6

_[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/), Machine Learning, Week 2.6._

_You can access this assignment with the following link: [classroom.github.com/a/4eqqszSo](https://classroom.github.com/a/4eqqszSo)._

This week the programming assignment takes a dataset and splits it into a training, validation and testing set. This is an essential part of working with machine learning models.

The PA also covers random number generation and implementation of `assert` statements (review).

There are three files:
- `README.md`
- `PA_2_6_3_way_split.ipynb`
- `data.csv`
- `environment.yml` an environment file for Week 2.6

## Instructions

Complete the notebook.

An environment file is also included in this PA. You can get ready for the workshop on Wednesday by setting up a conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you are still unsure how to set up and use environments, please _visit question hours!_

## Grading Criteria

You will pass this PA if:
1. Your notebook `PA_2_6_3_way_split.ipynb` runs without errors.
