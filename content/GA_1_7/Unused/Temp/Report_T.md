# Report for Group Assignment 1.3

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.7, Friday, Oct 18, 2024.*

_Remember to read the grading and submission instructions in the `README.md` file thoroughly before finalizing your answers in this document!_

## Questions

**Question 1**

Give a short description of the provided dataset in statistical terms. Visualize the data and choose a parametric distribution function for each variable between the indicated ones: choose between Exponential and Gaussian distribution to model the wave height, and between Uniform and Gumbel. Justify your choice based on the previous description and visualization. 

_You should describe your data with only a few sentences, and be sure to use quantitative information! Refer to that description to choose the parametric distribution function. You can also include some plots that may support your reasoning._


**Question 2**

Fit and assess the goodness of fit of the selected parametric distribution functions to the dataset. Use (at least) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and one graphical technique. For the graphical technique, choose between the QQplot and logscale plot. Describe in a few sentences how the chosen parametric distribution functions performs.

_Remember to use quantitative information!_


**Question 3**

Propagate the uncertainty through the equation to estimate wave forces, $F_h$, using both observations and simulated samples. Discuss the differences between the two obtained distributions.

**Question 4**

Compare the simulated samples and the observations in a scatter plot. What are the differences? Is there anything you could improve in the analysis?

_Hint: Compute the correlation coefficient between H and T for both the observations and the simulated samples._


**Last Question: How did things go? (Optional)**

_Use this space to let us know if you ran into any challenges while working on this GA, and if you have any feedback to report._
