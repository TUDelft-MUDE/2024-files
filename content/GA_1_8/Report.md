# Report for Group Assignment 1.8

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.8, Friday, Oct 18, 2024.*

_Remember to read the grading and submission instructions in the `README.md` file thoroughly before finalizing your answers in this document!_

_Note also that you can draw on the analyses completed in weeks 7 and 8 to justify the answers (i.e., WS 1.7, GA 1.7 and WS 1.8)._

## Questions

**Question 1**

Give a (very) short description of data set and the marginal distributions that you will use. State why you are using the selected marginal distributions, as well as the correlation coefficient between the two data sets.

_The only purpose of this question is to make it crystal clear to your teachers what distributions you are using and why, so be **clear** and **concise.** It would be very useful to describe your distributions and the moments, location and scale parameters in a Markdown table!_

_Your answer here._

**Question 2**

Describe the bivariate distribution that you created qualitatively, then provide a Markdown table that summarizes the probability calculations made, comparing empirical and theoretical results. Comment on the differences in probability values, using your understanding of (joint) probability density and the figures to justify your explanation. 

_Your answer here._

**Question 3**

Comment on the fit of $Z$. use at least 1 GoF metric from last week on the distribution (simulated versus empirical). Is it better or worse than last week? Justify your answer with quantitative and qualitative results.

_Your answer here._

**Question 4**

The Bivariate model used in this assignment incorporates non-Gaussian marginal distributions and dependence. Which of these two aspects do you think has a bigger impact on the findings you described in Question 3? You may want to include additional analyses to support your argument (for example, changing the marginal distributions and correlation coefficient).

_You are not required to create extra figures or tables for this question, but it could help justify your answer._

_Your answer here._

**Last Question: How did things go? (Optional)**

_Use this space to let us know if you ran into any challenges while working on this GA, and if you have any feedback to report._
