# README for Group Assignment 1.8

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.8, Friday, Oct 25, 2024.*

_You can access this assignment with the following link: [classroom.github.com/a/PeMbL9Y1](https://classroom.github.com/a/PeMbL9Y1)._

GA 1.8 investigates the effect of dependence by applying multivariate distributions to the data sets from the previous assignment, GA 1.7.

There are several files to be aware of:

1. `README.md`
2. The "typical" `Analysis.ipynb` and `Report.md` files
3. `helper.py`: a Python script with the `Bivarate` class and `plot_contour` function
4. `./data/` a subdirectory containing the data sets used in GA 1.7

The tasks in `Analysis.ipynb` are nearly identical to those of WS 1.8.

First, you should **choose a dataset** to use. (along with the distributions). We recommend using the same thing you did last week in GA 1.7, but you are welcome to switch if you like. See the README for GA 1.7 for a refresher on the context. You are also free to look at the solution for GA 1.7 when making your choice.

It might be useful to start out by adding your notebook from last week to your repository (copy/paste > commit > push!).

Finally, note that you can draw on the analyses completed in weeks 7 and 8 to justify the answers in your Report (i.e., WS 1.7, GA 1.7 and WS 1.8).

The working method is the same as in prior weeks.

## Task Overview

We recommend leaving around 60 minutes at the end of the session to work on the Report.

We recommend you do Task 1 together, then it may be possible to split up the calculations in Tasks 2 and 3, especially since those tasks are similar to that done in WS 1.8.

If you are short on time, remember that it is more important to have answers in the Report than a completed notebook. Explain any issues you faced with the programming in your Report.
