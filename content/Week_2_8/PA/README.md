# PA 2.8: The Final PA!

_[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/), Week 8 of Quarter 2._

All you need to do to complete this programming assignment is to complete the survey at [this link](). 

_Yes, it is a bit long, but the information will be useful to us, as well as future students. We hope you also find it useful to reflect on your programming journey in MUDE, as many of you have made huge improvements. I can't tell you how happy it makes me when you come to me with questions about a specific error in your traceback, rather than simply asking me "why did my notebook break?"_ :)

You will pass this PA if:
1. you complete the survey and enter your name/student number in the first question

As there is no GitHub repository for this assignment, it will only be confirmed via Brightspace when we update PA grades.
