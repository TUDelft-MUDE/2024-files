# README for Group Assignment 1.4

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.4, Friday, Sep 27, 2024.*

_See the README for more information about this assignment._

Q1: it is often not answered why we should try a new model.

Q2: often units are missing or are completely wrong. Precision is often omitted or wrongly reported (since the difference between precision and accuracy appears to be misunderstood).

Q3: missing comparison in many cases, and often information is neglected since most likely wrong (e.g. critical value for the testing, which is often wrong)

Q4: Latest question has been missed by almost all groups, i.e. how will you monitor the deformation if you have both GNSS and InSAR data at your disposal?

Overall the quality of English is poor; try using a digital tool to check grammar. VS Code has a number of useful extensions, for example the "Code Spell Checker." Incomplete sentences happened occasionally, which we hope were a result of VS Code live share and its erratic behavior. In any case, make sure you proof-read your Report files before submitting them on GitHub!
