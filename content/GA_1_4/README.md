# README for Group Assignment 1.4

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.4, Friday, Sep 27, 2024.*

_You can access this assignment with the following link: [COMING SOON]()._

GA 1.4 continues from where GA 1.3 left off by using the non-linear least squares method to create a non-linear model of the InSAR and GNSS satellite data to evaluate road deformation.

There are several files to be aware of:

1. `README.md`: this file, which contains an introduction and instructions.
2. `Analysis.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook which contains the primary analysis to complete during the in-class session.
3. `Report.md`: a Markdown file containing questions about the findings of Analysis, as well additional questions to check your understanding of the topic for this week.
4. `functions.py`: a Python file that defines various functions for use the notebook
5. `setup.py`: a Python file that setups repeats the analysis from GA 1.3 and saves the results to a pickle file for loading into `Analysis.ipynb`
6. Auxiliary files: a `data` subdirectory that contains `csv` and `pickle` files.

The grade for this assignment will be determined as follows (described below):

- The notebook `Analysis.ipynb` is worth 20%
- The weight of each question in the `Report.md` is determined as follows:

1. 15%
2. 35%
3. 15%
4. 15%

Assignment submission, grading and working method are identical to last week. Review the [GA 1.3 README](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/files/GA_1_3/README.html) as needed.

## Assignment Context

The introduction of the non-linear model is included in `Analysis.ipynb`. See the [GA 1.3 README](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/files/GA_1_3/README.html) for background information.
