# PA 2.1: Classy City

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 2.1. Due: before Friday, November 15th, 2024.*

Welcome to the first programming assignment of Q2! Remember what OOP from PA 1.7 stands for? Object Oriented Programming! We though it would be great to start off the quarter by reviewing this concept.

The attached notebook will refresh your memory on how classes work, as well as prepare you for the analysis we will do next week as part of the Finite Volume Topic. It turns out the triangles and the coordinates you compute in the PA are directly analogous to the 2D mesh of volumes and faces that you will need to use next week!

**Remember to review the [book chapter from Week 1.7 on OOP](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/book/external/learn-programming/book/python/oop/classes.html)**

## Grading Criteria

You will pass this PA if:
1. Your notebook `PA_2_1_classy_city.ipynb` runs without errors.
