# PA 1.4: MUDE-git-crossword and Ice prediction
*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.5. Due: before Friday, October 4th, 2024.*

## Introduction

You can access the assignment with this link: [classroom.github.com/a/-](https://classroom.github.com/a/-)

This PA consists of 4 parts:

1. `PA_1_5_zzzzz.ipynb`: a notebook covering a few simple Python topics that are especially useful for the WS and GA assignments this week.
2. [Programming for Week 1.5](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/book/programming/week_1_5.html) (Online Textbook): read this chapter, which covers more Git topics: branching, forking, pull requests and merge conflicts
3. `crossword.md`: file containing a crossword puzzle, where you will work on a separate branch and merge commits into the `main` branch.
4. `XXXXXXX:yyyyyyy.csv`: a file in a _separate_ repository (`XXXXXXX`) where you will contribute a commit from your own fork of the separate repository

Notes:
- The notebook can be completed independently from the other parts; try to finish complete this before the Wednesday in-class session.
- This PA actually involves 3 repositories: the one created for this assignment, the ice repository and your own personal fork of the ice repository, which you will create.

You will pass this PA if:
1. For the python and markdown topics of this PA. 
  - Your notebook `PA_1_5_zzzzz.ipynb` runs without errors.
  - Your repository contains a file `my_figure.svg` located in subdirectory `figures`
  - You update the `myfigure.md` file to include a figure.
2. For the branching part of this PA: you successfully merged a pull request from your own branch.
3. For the forking part of this PA: You successfully created a pull request to the ice repo.

You can verify that you passed checks 1-4 by looking for the green circle in this repository. It runs automatically just like last week when you uploaded your notebook. For the ice repository (check 2), you'll pass when your pull request is accepted (this requires some manual actions from your teachers on your pull request) and you see your bet in the bet in ... .
