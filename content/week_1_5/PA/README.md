# PA 1.4: MUDE-git-crossword and Ice prediction
*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.5. Due: before Friday, October 4th, 2024.*

## Introduction

This PA consists of 4 parts:

1. `PA_1_5_.useful_tricks.ipynb`: a notebook covering a few simple Python topics that are especially useful for the WS and GA assignments this week.
2. [Programming for Week 1.5](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/2024/book/programming/week_1_5.html) (Online Textbook): read this chapter, which covers more Git topics: branching, forking, pull requests and merge conflicts
3. `crossword.md`: file containing a crossword puzzle, which you will use to work on a separate branch and merge commits into the `main` branch.
4. `XXXXXXX:yyyyyyy.csv`: a file in a _separate_ repository (`XXXXXXX`) where you will contribute a commit from your own fork of the separate repository

Notes:
- The notebook can be completed independently from the other parts; try to finish complete this before the Wednesday in-class session.
- This PA actually involves 3 repositories: the one created for this assignment, the ice repository and your own personal fork of the ice repository, which you will create.

You will pass this PA if:
1. For the python and markdown topics of this PA.
  - Your notebook `PA_1_5_useful_tricks.ipynb` runs without errors.
  - Your repository contains a file `my_figure.svg` located in subdirectory `/figures`
  - You update the `myfigure.md` file to include a reference to the previous figure.
2. For the branching part of this PA: you successfully merged a pull request from your own branch.
3. For the forking part of this PA: You successfully created a pull request to the ice repo with your bet (it should be visible on`XXXXX pull request list on ICE REPO`_. It will accepted (this requires some manual actions from your teachers on your pull request) afterwards you see your bet in the bet in `XXXXXX`.

You can verify that you passed checks 1 and 2 by looking for the green circle in this repository. It runs automatically just like last week when you uploaded your notebook.
