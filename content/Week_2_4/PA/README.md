# PA12 Information, Week 2.4

_[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/), Time Series Analysis, Week 4 of Quarter 2._

This week the programming assignment is based on three files:
- `README.md`: instructions for PA12 and environment creation (this document)
- `PA12A_gurobilicious.ipynb`: set-up of Gurobi software for Week 2.5 (optimization) with a new conda environment
- `PA12B_axes_of_awesome.ipynb`: Python-related tools used in Week 2.4 for Time Series Analysis


## Instructions

Read through this file (`README.md`). This `README.md` also includes a task on creating a new conda environment. Afterwards complete the tasks in notebooks `PA12A` and `PA12B`. Note that `PA12A` will refer you to the MUDE website, where you will find [instructions for setting up the Gurobi license file](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/gurobi/).

### Assessment criteria

The assessment criteria for PA12 is specified in each notebook, respectively, but the general idea is to make sure both notebooks run without errors. In addition, notebook 12A will generate a file `license.lic` that must be committed to your repository to confirm that the Gurobi software has been installed correctly on your computer.

## Next steps

Once you have successfully installed our new environment and you have activated it, you are ready to proceed with the rest of this assignment (`PA12A.ipynb` and `PA12B.ipynb`).

We simply presented the instructions for creating an environment in this README; if you would like to read more about this, you should refer to the [Anaconda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). You can also read about creating an environment file on the same page [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-file-manually), if interested.
