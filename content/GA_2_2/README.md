# README for Group Assignment 2.2

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 2.2, Friday, Nov 22, 2024.*

GA 2.2 applies the finite element method (FEM) to a 2D problem with a fun geometry.

There are several files to be aware of:

1. `README.md`
2. A notebook `the_big_M.ipynb` (equivalent to the previous `Analysis.ipynb` files)
3. A `Report.md` file for answering questions
4. File `big_M.msh` and `big_M_fine.msh`: define two FEM mesh' to use in the analysis

## Primary Task

Run the analysis in `the_big_M.ipynb`, inspect the code (really **really** read it!) and results, then answer the questions in `Report.md`.

Note that unlike other GA's, besides reading and understanding the contents, you don't have to do anything with the code in the notebook before reading the Report questions; this will then ask you to modify the notebook.

## Python environment

To run the code for this assignment **add a new Python package** to your `mude-base` environment:

```
conda activate mude-base
conda install ipympl
```
Remember to install before running your notebook. If you did not do this, you may have to restart the kernel in your notebook.
