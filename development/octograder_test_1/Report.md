*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week X.X. Due: Month X, 2024.*

This is a mock assignment to be used as a test for the OctoGrader System.

## Question 1

_Why is the sky blue?_

**Question 2: which question formatting is better?**

_Answer_

**Question 3:** _Can we make this better?_

We could implement some cool things, for example:
- tags to identify questions and answers
- a script to auto-format Q and A spaces properly and check if students have entered a response
- free-for-all / do nothing
