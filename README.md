# MUDE Files 2024

This repository primarily contains MUDE Files from the 2024-25 academic year. MUDE stands for Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, a required module in the MSc programs from the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.

In particular there are several types of files:

1. Weekly assignments and solutions: programming assignments (PA), workshops (WS) and group assignments (GA). These are located in directory `content/`.
2. 

Primary location for module materials, for example: assignments, solutions, lecture slides (final versions only), etc. Includes work in progress and final versions.

Similar to [repository `mude/2023`](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/mude/2023) from last year.

Files will be deployed to the webserver based on the versions in this repository.
