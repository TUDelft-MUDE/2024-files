In this exercise we will consider the response due to a single event, $h_k(t)$. Groundwater flows through pores in the aquifer much slower than the application of $h_k(t)$ at time $t_0$. Therefore, the aquifer responds to event $k$ according to a step-response function, $s(t-t_0)$, which has the general form illustrated in the figure below. If the event has a constant value and continues indefinitely after $t_0$ the aquifer will eventually reach a steady-state value $r$ (a scaling factor of $a=1$ is used).\n",
