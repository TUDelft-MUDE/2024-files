For example, if we have 10 years worth of hourly measurements, but would like to evaluate the monthly or weekly characteristics. Often we can store our data in a structured way and then use some indexing capabilities of Numpy to evaluate it in a smart way. Check out the following simple tips, then try and apply it in practice."

    "Now that we have three years of data, we want to see if there is a trend in our behavior. We can take the correlation concepts we learned in Q1 and see if there is a relationship from one month to the next. In other words: if we spend a lot of coins one month, is the _probability_ that we spend a lot of coins the next month _higher_? Evaluating correlation this way has many names: autocorrelation, autocovariance, etc...the \"auto\" in this case refers to evaluating the relationship between data from the same sequence (you will learn about it more in the time series reading). Luckily, there is a built-in method of `statsmodels` that does this for us automatically: the correlation is plotted on the y-axis between the distance away from any point in the series. It is important to recognize that the correlations represent any point in the series (analogous to an average), rather than any specific point)\n",
