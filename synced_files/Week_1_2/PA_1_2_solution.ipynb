    "## Task 4: Application 1---Modelling with normal distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Task we will combine several MUDE topics: modelling concepts, uncertainty, numpy arrays, a function of random variables and propagation of uncertainty. It may seem like a lot, but in the end you are only asked to make a few small changes to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Task one of the strategies to keep our code organized is to use **functions.** It is very useful to write simple functions to that can be used repeatedly in our analysis. In addition, it is important to recognize that rather than importing data we are *simulating* our own data using random samples from the normal distributions for length and width. Why? One reason is perhaps we already know what the distribution of values is, and we don't have enough measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the length and width each have a Normal distribution as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "height \\sim \\mathcal{N}(5000, 25) \\\\\n",
    "width \\sim \\mathcal{N}(2000, 100)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact steps for the Task are:\n",
    "1. Create a random sample for two random variables: length and width of an object\n",
    "2. Compute the output of the function of random variables: area\n",
    "3. Plot the histogram of area\n",
    "4. Compute the mean and standard deviation of area\n",
    "5. Compute the PDF of area and add it to the histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this, we will start by writing **four functions** to automate the process. You will see the advantage of writing functions in the beginning of your code, because it makes the code much easier to write, run and interpret later! You may also want to refer to Chapters 1 and 3 of the [online Python course](https://teachbooks.github.io/learn-python/main/intro.html) to refresh your memory of functions."
