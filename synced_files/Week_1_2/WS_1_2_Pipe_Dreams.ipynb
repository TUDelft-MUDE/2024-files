    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will apply the propagation laws for the mean and variance for a function of two independent random variables. You will assess how well the approximations correspond with the <em>simulation-based</em> equivalents. You will also assess the distribution of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "_You do not need to turn in this notebook._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe how uncertainty \"propagates\" from the inputs to the output of a function by estimating moments of the function of random variables and seeing how they change relative to the moments of the input random variables.\n",
    "2. Recognize that a non-linear function of random variables that have the (joint) Normal distribution (the inputs) produces a non-Normal random variable (the output).\n",
    "3. Using _sampling_ (Monte Carlo Simulation) to _validate_ the linearized error propagation technique introduced in the textbook. Specifically, by:\n",
    "   1. Comparing the estimated moments with that of the sample, and\n",
    "   2. Comparing the Normal distribution defined by the estimated moments to the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on \"Sampling\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Monte Carlo Simulation to create an empirical \"sample\" of the random values of our function of random variables, $V$ (the output). This is a commonly used approach widely used in science and engineering applications. It is a numerical way of computing the distribution of a function that is useful when analytic approaches are not possible (for example, when the input distributions are non-Normal or the function is non-linear). For our purposes today, Monte Carlo Simulation is quite simple and involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function of random variables and the distributions of its input parameters.\n",
    "2. Create a random sample of each input parameter according to the specified distribution.\n",
    "3. Create a random sample of the output variable by computing the function for every set of input samples.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the resulting distribution of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key points to recognize are:\n",
    "1. As the sample size increases, the resulting distribution becomes more accurate.\n",
    "2. This is a way to get the (approximately) \"true\" distribution of a function of random variables.\n",
    "3. Accuracy is relative to the propagation of uncertainty through the function based on the assumed distributions of the input random variables. In other words, MCS can't help you if your function and distributions are poor representations of reality!\n",

    "### Application: Sewer Pipe Flow Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply Manning's formula for the flow velocity $V$ in a sewer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V =\\frac{1}{n}R^{2/3}S^{1/2}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "where $R$ is the hydraulic radius of the sewer pipe (in $m$), $S$ the slope of the pipe (in $m/m$), and $n$ is the coefficient of roughness [$-$].\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $R$ and $S$ are random variables, as it is known that sewer pipes are susceptible to deformations; $n$ is assumed to be deterministic and in our case $n=0.013$ $s/m^{1/3}$. The sewer pipe considered here has mean values $\\mu_R$, $\\mu_S$, and standard deviations $\\sigma_R$ and $\\sigma_S$; $R$ and $S$ are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now interested in the mean flow velocity in the sewer as well as the uncertainty expressed by the standard deviation. This is important for the design of the sewer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: the dimensions of the pipe come from a real case study, but some aspects of the exercise are...less realistic.*\n",

    "\n",
    "In Part 2 we used a sample of the function of random variables to _validate_ the Taylor approximation (we found that they are generally well-approximated). Now we will assume that the function of random variables has the Normal distribution to validate the moments and see for which range of values they remain a good approximation. This is done by comparing the sample to the assumed distribution; the former is represented by a histogram (also called an empirical probability density function, PDF, when normalized), the latter by a Normal distribution with moments calculated using the Taylor approximation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The method `probplot` is built into `scipy.stats` (Documentation [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.probplot.html)) and _validates_ a probability model by comparing samples (i.e., data) to a theoretical distribution (in this case, Normal). The \"Theoretical quantile\" that is plotted on the x-axis of this plot and measures the distance from the median of a distribution, normalized by the standard deviation, such that $\\mathrm{quantile}=q\\cdot\\sigma$. For example, $q=-1.5$ is $\\mu-1.5\\cdot\\sigma$. The vertical axis is the value of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are comparing a theoretical distribution and a sample (data) on the same plot, one of the lines is the Normal PDF, which of course will have an exact match with the _theoretical quantiles_. This is why the Normal PDF will plot as a straight line in `probplot`. Comparing the (vertical) distance between the samples and the theoretical distribution (the red line) allows us to _validate_ our model. In particular, it allows us to validate the model for different regions of the distribution. In your interpretation, for example, you should try and identify whether the model is a good fit for the center and/or tails of the distribution.\n",
