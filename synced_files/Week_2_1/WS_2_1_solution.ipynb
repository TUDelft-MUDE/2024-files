    "1. This is in general how the code works: you should have seen that for each case, once you define the Python variables, there are ready-made functions to complete the analysis: first by running the simulation (`run_simulation_1D`) which initializes the volumes (`initialize_1D`) then sets up the time (the loop over `t`) and space integration (`advection_1D`). Then you can plot the initial condition (`plot_1D`) and visualize each time step (`plot_1D_all`).  \n",
    "2. Applying the cyclic boundary condition is very simple: you only need to shift the indexing from the \"math\" in the textbook by 1 when implementing in Python. This does introduce a slight error since you are actually calculating $phi$ for a volume to the left of your index; however, for small volumes it is negligible (and you could shift it back in each time step, if you wanted).  \n",
    "3. Note also that the cyclic boundary does not have any mathematical basis, and is not modelling \"reality\" in any way. It is a convenient \"trick\" that we use to make it easy to observe how the wave moves in space without worrying about the particular location of the wave (x) at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key things to notice about the activities in this assignment:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Part 1, we see that the central scheme is _very_ unstable (default settings).  \n",
    "2. In Part 2: making the initial condition smooth helps...for a short time (set `square=False`).\n",
    "3. In Part 3: upwinding becomes (conditionally) stable; if CFL<1.0, you will see false diffusion.\n",
    "4. In Part 4: we use the CFL number to confirm stability regions. Note that if you use a CFL of 0.8 and your solution is unstable, you implemented the upwinding scheme incorrectly. Check the tips above about the cyclic indexing to help solve your issue; note also that regardless of if or how you implemented the cyclic boundary condition, if you are using points that are to the \"right\" of the index for `p_new` then you did not implement upwinding correctly (for example, if you compute `p_new[i]` and the calculation includes a point `p[i + 1]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we notice the above points is because our PDE is convection (hyperbolic) and our pulse is moving to the right, which implies that the upwind cells (volumes) are more important (they have a larger weight). Even though backward difference (the upwind scheme) is a lower-accuracy method (first order) than central averaging (second order), it is more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to recognize **three types of numerical issues** that are present in this assignment:\n",
    "1. Instability caused by the nature of the PDE (a hyperbolic equation), combined with the numerical scheme (central averaging in space and forward Euler in time).\n",
    "2. Instability as described by the CFL criterion.\n",
    "3. Numerical diffusion (false diffusion), which is inherent in upwind schemes (an explanation is outside of the scope of MUDE: we are happy as long as you recognize this can be an issue!).\n",
    "\n",
    "_After the general comments here, the solution has been implemented in the code below. There is also a large section of code that facilitates the use of dictionaries to keep track of analysis cases; it's not part of the MUDE exam material, but you might find it useful when working on your projects, especially if you are working on a situation when you would like to evaluate a lot of scenarios and keep track of the input parameters. For example, you can see that each dictionary stores the variable values and a name describing it._"

    "## Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop the [advection problem covered in the textbook] is treated first in 1D and then in 2D. There are two main objectives:\n",
    "1. Understand the advection problem itself (how the quantity of interest is transported by the velocity field)\n",
    "2. Explore characteristics of the numerical analysis schemes employed, in particular: numerical diffusion and FVM stability\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we will do the following:\n",
    "- Implement the central difference and upwind schemes in space for FVM and Forward Euler in time\n",
    "- Apply a boundary condition such that the quantity of interest repeatedly travels through the plot window (this helps us visualize the process!)\n",
    "- Evaluate stability of central difference and upwind schemes in combination with Forward Euler in time\n",
    "- Use the CFL to understand numerical stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming requirements: you will need to fill in a few missing pieces of the functions, but mostly you will change the values of a few Python variables to evaluate different aspects of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python variables will be defined to set up the problem:\n",
    "```\n",
    "p0 = initial value of our \"pulse\" (the quantity of interest, phi) [-]\n",
    "c = speed of the velocity field [m/s]\n",
    "L = length of the domain [m]\n",
    "Nx = number of volumes in the direction x\n",
    "T = duration of the simulation (maximum time) [s]\n",
    "Nt = number of time steps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two flag variables: 1) `central` will allow you to switch between central and backward spatial discretization schemes, and 2) `square` changes the pulse from a square to a smooth bell curve (default for both is `True`; don't worry about it until instructed to change it).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 2D case, `c`, `L`, `Nx` are extended as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "c --> cx, cy\n",
    "L --> Lx, Ly\n",

    "## Part 1: Implement Central Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to implement the central difference scheme as derived in the textbook; however, **instead of implementing the system of equations in a matrix formulation**, we will _loop over each of the finite volumes in the system,_ one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we will want to watch the \"pulse\" travel over a long period of time, we will take advantage of the reverse-indexing of Python (i.e., the fact that an index `a[-3]`, for example, will access the third item from the end of the array or list). When taking the volumes to the left of the first volume in direction $x$, we can use the values of $phi$ from the \"last\" volumes in $x$ (the end of the array). All we need to do is shift the index for $phi_i$ such that we avoid a situation where `i+1` \"breaks\" the loop (because the maximum index is `i`). In other words, only volumes with index `i` or smaller should be used (e.g., instead of `i-1`, `i`,  and `i+1`, use `i-2`, `i-1` and `i`."

    "Switching to the upwind scheme gives a stable solution. Note the numerical diffusion (change from cubic to bell shape). Also, as the edges of the bell shape spread outside of the X-Y domain, you will see them appear on the corners: this is a result of the fact that the iteration loops over X and Y in the meshgrid format don't properly find the \"neighbor\" volumes. To understand this, refer to the textbook where the matrix form of the 2D solution is presented and see how the index of the neighbor volumes is not sequential as in the for loops.\n",
