    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we apply a few simple concepts from the textbook to derive a safety standard to regulate spills in a chemical factory. You are asked to consider an economic and societal standard, then make a recommendation to the city council.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "A city with population 10,000 uses an aquifer for its water supply, as illustrated in the figure. The city owns a factory in the region that manufactures hazardous chemicals, and recently a chemical spill occurred that resulted in 10 residents getting sick and total damages of  €7,000M*. The city is going to enforce stricter regulations on the factory, and _you have been hired to advise the city council on the maximum allowable probability of a spill occurring (per year)_. You will make a recommendation based on the more stringent criteria between economic and societal risk limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "![sketch of factory, houses and contamination plume](./sketch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Experts have been consulted and it appears under the current plan the probability of a spill is 1/100 per year. The city council is considering two strategies to upgrade the spill prevention system. A small upgrade would cost €25M and can reduce spill probability by a factor 10; a large upgrade with investment costs of €50M would reduce the probability by factor 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The city has also considered the regulations in a nearby region which uses a maximum allowable probability of 1 person getting sick as $p_f=0.01$. The city agrees with this, however, they are very much _risk averse_ (that's a hint!), regarding spills with more significant consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "_*M = million, so 7,000M is 7e9, or 7 billion. All costs in this exercise are expressed in units €M._"
