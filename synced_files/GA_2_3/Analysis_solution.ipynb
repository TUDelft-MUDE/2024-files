    "\n",
    "This project covers the week on Signal Processing (week 2.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a warming up you will create and analyze some elementary signals yourself, and next, you will carry out frequency domain analyses on two given data-sets, namely acceleration measurements of a Cantilever-Beam experiment, and (in optional Task 10) Global Mean Sea-Level measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the Tasks in this notebook consist of both coding, producing a plot, and answering (open) questions. Typically, as you work your way through the Tasks, you can often re-use code, or part of it, from earlier Tasks and assignments. That will save you a lot of work!!"

    "### Data Acquisition System\n",
    "\n",
    "A data acquisition (DAQ) system usually consists of four components:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sensor transforms a physical signal into a small voltage. The transformation is often frequency dependent or nonlinear, and can show drift or bias.\n",
    "- Signal conditioning electronics (often included in the sensor housing) filter unwanted frequencies, such as the 50 Hz line frequency caused by power plant generators, using low-pass or notch filters. In addition the sensor voltage may be amplified.\n",
    "- An analog-to-digital (A/D) converter samples the analog voltage with a certain rate, such as 100 Hz. The A/D converter can measure analog voltages within a certain range, the measurement range. The measured voltage is quantized with a certain resolution, such as 14-bit, which means that the full measurement range is divided into $2^{14}=16,384$ discrete intervals. Together, the resolution and measurement range determine the precision. Usually the sample rate, the measurement range, and the sample resolution are configurable. Sampling and quantizing together turns an analog signal into a digital signal.\n",
    "- A digital computer reads the sampled data from the A/D converter at specific times, and allows for further processing, analysis and storage of the (digital) signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that an analog, physical signal, is turned into a series of numbers (samples of the signal, in the time domain), ready for processing and analysis in a digital computer.\n",

    "One of the data sets that you will analyze during this MUDE Q2 project was acquired by an accelerometer in a smartphone, on top of a vertical cantilever-beam. The accelerometer measures the side-ward accelerations, expressed in m/s<sup>2</sup>, and sampled at 50 Hz. Detailed information about the experiment and the sensor can be found in \"Experimental evaluation of smartphone accelerometer and low-cost dual frequency GNSS sensors for deformation monitoring\", by Alexandru Lapadat, Christian Tiberius and Peter Teunissen, Sensors 2021, 21, 7946, https://doi.org/10.3390/s21237946.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick impression of the test setup can be gained by watching the short video [Cantilever Beam Experiment](https://youtu.be/o4moRwvlBLU?si=aKelBMWm3HB2Of26) (1 minute).\n",
    "\n",
    "A theoretical description of the motion of the smartphone accelerometer fixed to the cantilever beam is presented in Appendix A. Pulling the beam at the tip and releasing it, results in a (nearly) horizontal side-ward motion of the smartphone, and the (horizontal) position can be described by a *damped harmonic* as a function of time. Consequently, also the first and second derivative with respect to time, the velocity and acceleration as a function of time as the smartphone will measure it, are harmonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic sinusoid signal\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start with first creating (and analyzing) a few simple signals yourself. In the first few Tasks of this project, we will take the damping ratio zero and use a fairly short measurement time (duration), and hence the acceleration measured by the smartphone is a plain (undamped) sinusoid as shown in Appendix A (a stationary signal). In the following Tasks we also add a phase offset $\\varphi$ to the plain sinusoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi f_c t + \\varphi)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is taken from the last equation in Appendix A. We consider here acceleration, though for convenience, we omit the dots on top of the $x(t)$."

Note that, for example, with $N=10$ samples at a sampling rate of $f_s = 100$ Hz, we have signal samples at times $t=0.00, 0.01, 0.02, ... , 0.08, 0.09$ seconds, hence $T_{meas}= N \\Delta t =0.1$ seconds (the sample-and-hold convention).\n",

A continuous time sinusoid with amplitude $A$ will produce a magnitude of $\\frac{A T_{meas}}{2}$ in the amplitude spectrum (with $T_{meas}$ the *measurement time* or duration), rather than $\\frac{A}{2}$ which you would expect (in a double-sided spectrum). This is because of the limited time duration of the input signal, which actually implies multiplication of $x(t)$ by a *rectangular time window* $w(t)=\\Pi(\\frac{t}{T_{meas}})$. Since the sinusoid has an amplitude of $A=1$ V, and was measured for $T_{meas}=5$ seconds, the magnitude becomes 2.5. The magnitude at all other frequencies is very small, approximately $10^{-15}$, or approximately zero.\n",

This results in a *scale factor* in the spectrum when the DFT of signals with different sample rates are compared. To solve this, we have to multiply the DFT as calculated by NumPy by the sample time interval $\\Delta t = 1/f_s$ to restore the time dimension and obtain a *discrete approximation of the continuous Fourier Transform*. To account for the measurement duration as described above, we have to divide by $T_{meas} = N \\Delta t$.

In addition the measurements may contain (unwanted) effects of the sensor (think of an offset, due to imperfect manufacturing and/or prior calibration, or a drift over time, for instance due to temperature changes in the electronics during the experiment). By detrending we mean to remove such effects, prior to our spectral analysis, so that we can start with a nice, zero mean signal. A-priori detrending is good practice and generally yields a cleaner spectrum. Next week (week 2.4 on Time Series Analysis) we cover the subject of removing unwanted effects from the signal in more detail, as to obtain a so-called **stationary** signal, meaning that the properties or characteristics of the signal (such as the mean) do not change over time, and, we provide practical means to “stationarize” a given or measured signal.\n",

But, earlier in the MUDE, in week 1.3, you learned about least-squares parameter estimation, and that's what you can apply to do the detrending (and actually built-in functions just apply the very same principle). Next week, on Time Series Analysis, you will actually be covering (again) the estimation of a trend in a time series of measurements.\n",
    "As a re-cap for week 1.3: when a series of observations $y_1, …, y_m$ (in our case with $m=N$) is supposed or expected to exhibit a functional linear trend (a straight line in terms of a graph), this can be modelled as\n",
